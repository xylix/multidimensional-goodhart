## Iteration 1

Question tackled: dimensional dependence of hidden Goodhart harm under threshold selection.

What changed: created the research file structure and added a first linear-Gaussian toy model. The main calculation shows that, for `X ~ N(0, Sigma)` and selection on `X_1 >= t`, hidden mean drift is `sigma_1 lambda(t / sigma_1) r`, where `r` is the vector of covariance ratios between hidden coordinates and the selected proxy.

What's open now: dimensional scaling requires assumptions about how `||r||_2` grows with the number of hidden dimensions. The correct harm functional remains unsettled.

Red flags fired: one `[confident]` claim triggered adversarial review. It survived only with explicit restriction to the Gaussian toy model.
